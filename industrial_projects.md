## Our group has sufficient experiencies in a number of fields

# Applications of Massive Data Processing and Predictive Maintenance Technology
1. Auxiliary Power Unit Failures Prediction
2. Quick Aerodynamic Design of Passenger Aircraft Layout
3. Design of the side panel of F1 car

# Applications of Deep Learning Technology
1. 3D data processing
2. 3D shape recognition

## Research projects in colloboration with such comapanies as [DATADVANCE](https://www.datadvance.net/ru/) have been resulted in implementation software libaries
1. pSeven Core (aka MACROS Library) was developed for Surrogate Modeling and Optimization ()

# Quality assurance:
- Technology Readiness Level 6
- [according to Airbus experts, application of MACROS “provides the reduction of up to 10% of lead time and cost in several areas of the aircraft design process”](http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/airbus-to-reduce-lead-times-in-numerical-analysis-activities-for-aircraft-design/)
- [a number of important industrial projects were successfully completed](http://www.aerospace-technology.com/news/newsairbus-uses-datadvances-macros-software-structural-analysis-a350-xwb-aircraft-4362144)

# Efficient solution of the use cases:
- structural analysis of composite stiffened panels on aircrafts;
- aerodynamic design of passenger aircraft layout.

2. PHM core of the library for predictive maintenance

# Quality assurance:
- Technology Readiness Level 5 (NASA classification).

# Efficient solution of the use cases:
- airplanes leakage detection, APU failures prediction, oil filter clogging detection;
- software-intensive systems: detection of outages of internet user services.
