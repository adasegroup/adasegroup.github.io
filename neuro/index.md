##### Who we are?

A group at CDISE led by Dr. Maxim Sharaev, Prof. Alexander Bernstein and prof. Evgeny Burnaev working on applied biomedical problems focused on large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data analysis.

##### What we do?

Complex research projects and applied tasks with leading Russian and foreign medical centers.

##### These tasks include:

* EEG/MRI/fMRI-based diagnostics and biomarkers search 
* radiologist assistance tools including neurosurgical and treatment planning
* outcome prediction
* neuroeducation methods based on eye-tracking, wearing sensors and EEG

##### What you will learn?

In our group youâ€™ll learn to:
* handle multimodal multidimensional heterogeneous data
* develop methods for cleaning noisy data 
* work with multi-site data and domain adaptation techniques
* work with classical ML: feature engineering, feature extraction and selection, sampling and validation techniques
* use Deep Learning and Computer Vision methods in your research: DL for predictive models based on imaging and time-series data, CV for image segmentation and anomaly detection
* work on real cases in clinics with doctors: develop strategies for data collection and labelling
and a lot more!
