The 3D Deep Learning team invites highly motivated students for work towards their Bachelor and Master theses. 
We offer research in the following directions: 3D Reconstruction from RGB-D and Point Clouds, Deep Computational Geometry Processing, Generative 3D Deep Learning. During the work, you will be able to understand the state-of-the-art in deep learning for 3D computer vision and geometry processing, perform real and/or computational experiments using the professional equipment, and contribute to research publications.

#### Requirements
- Strong C/C++ and/or Python programming level;
- Strong background in statistics, numerical optimization, algorithms, and learning;
- Knowledge of modern numerical software and deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others) is a strong plus;
- Extremely high motivation, commitment, and punctuality (of last yearâ€™s 12 Bachelor and Master students, 4 were unable to complete their theses in time).

Note that we cannot accept student applicants working (part-time or full-time) for commercial companies. This is due to the challenging nature of our research as well as to the strict deadlines we face.

#### How to apply
For your application, prepare your CV, Bachelor/Master transcripts, and (optionally) recommendation letters. Email your application directly to Dr. Alexey Artemov [a.artemov@skoltech.ru](mailto:a.artemov@skoltech.ru). We will respond within a few days, inviting you for a personal interview. During the interview, you will be asked to describe your previous experience (both academic and industrial). Please be aware that your theoretical and programming skills will be tested during the interview.

**Note:** we accept applications irrespective of your university of study, provided that all requirements are met. Do not hesitate to connect if you have any questions.
