> The goal of the project is to understand objective patterns of children and adolescent cognitive development, learning peculiarities and strategies. For this purpose we measure behavioral indexes, like accuracy or reaction time as well as neuroimaging markers in different task difficulty levels in order to find correlations with student’s performance, cognitive abilities and preferences. Here we work with ultrasound, eye-tracking, fMRI data and plan to add EEG. We also aim at finding these correlates as well as their dependencies on study programs.
