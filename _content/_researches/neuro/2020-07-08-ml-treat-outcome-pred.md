Acute stroke is one of the major causes of death and work disability in most countries, alongside with heart diseases. The type and severity of the stroke is diagnosed by the mearnis on neuroimaging, including Computed Tomography and MRI. Accurately predicting stroke outcome from a set of prognostic variables can identify patients at high risk and guide treatment approaches that will lead to lower morbidity. Our team explores aphasia (language disorder, affecting the ability to speak) progression and treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke based on MRI imaging and clinical data.
