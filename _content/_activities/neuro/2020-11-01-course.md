#### NEUROML course, FALL 2020 finished!

Congratulations for everyone involved - course went great. Some of the comments from anonymous feedback form:

"Everything was very good.It is enjoyable that there was no obligatory report, because this way it was easier to concentrate on interesting part of the work. I think that for the first iteration of the course it went great, and I'd like to especially emphasize Ekaterina's work as a TA which was done very thoroughly in my opinion. Big thanks!"

"In general I would say it was a nice experience, congrats to the lecturer and awesome TAs!"

"I believe that the course is nice and will be even better when the studies are offline again. Quizzes after lectures is a wonderful idea - a great way to review the lecture. The  course was great in general, the lecturer and TAs perfectly adapted the course to the quarantine mode."
