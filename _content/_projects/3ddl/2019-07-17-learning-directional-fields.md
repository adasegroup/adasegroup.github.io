excerpt: Reconstruction of directional fields is a need in many geometry processing tasks, such as image tracing, extraction of 3D geometric features, and finding principal surface directions. We propose a deep learning-based approach and study the expressive power and generalization ability.
abstract: Reconstruction of directional fields is a need in many geometry processing tasks, such as image tracing, extraction of 3D geometric features, and finding principal surface directions. A common approach to the construction of directional fields from data relies on complex optimization procedures, which are usually poorly formalizeable, require a considerable computational effort, and do not transfer across applications. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach and study the expressive power and generalization ability.
