# Lines starting with the # are comments. For clarity, remove them after you finish.
# This file is split in two sections: the header and the content.
# The header is enclosed in `---` and is a meta data of the project in YAML format.
# The content goes right after the closing `---` of the header,
# is written in Markdown and is compiled right into the project page.

# Name the file in the format yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-the-page.md,
# where yyyy-mm-dd is the date of publication (of the paper, not the project page).
# For example, the url of the project page for 2019-10-29-perceptual-depth-sr.md
# is http://adase.group/3ddl/projects/perceptual-depth-sr/ (more about /3ddl/ below).

#--- Remove the line below: it excludes this template from the site release.
published: false

#--- Do not change the layout unless you know what you're doing.
layout: project_page

#--- Optional parameter for switching to the subgroup-specific version of the site.
#--- I.e, compare the header at http://adase.group/dlpa/projects/nas-bench-nlp/
#--- with the header at http://adase.group/3ddl/projects/perceptual-depth-sr/
team: 3ddl

#--- Optional list of categories meant to be used for separation of research directions.
#--- For example, with
categories: 3ddl
#--- the project page will reside under adase.group/3ddl/projects/title , and
# categories: [category1, category2]
#--- will reside under adase.group/category1/category2/projects/title
#--- Note that the parent directory of the file,
#--- e.g _projects/3ddl for 2019-10-29-perceptual-depth-sr.md ,
#--- does not affect the url and is only used for grouping of the source files.

#--- Optional parameter allowing the project to appear on the title page of the website.
#--- The projects are sorted w.r.t front_id in the descending order.
#--- We put the fashionable projects in front of the others using front_id: 1XXX.
# front_id: 9999

excerpt: Short description of the project that will be displayed in the rich list of the projects.
#--- At the moment, only the 3DDL team uses the rich list http://adase.group/3ddl/publications/

abstract: Full abstract of the project that will be displayed in the project page.

#--- Optional bibtex that will be displayed in the materials section (see below); cannot contain double quotes.
bibtex: "\
@InProceedings{Koch_2019_CVPR,
author = {Koch, Sebastian and Matveev, Albert and Jiang, Zhongshi and Williams, Francis and Artemov, Alexey and Burnaev, Evgeny and Alexa, Marc and Zorin, Denis and Panozzo, Daniele},
title = {ABC: A Big CAD Model Dataset For Geometric Deep Learning},
booktitle = {The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)},

#--- Optional graphical abstract that will be displayed in the project page,
#--- e.g http://adase.group/3ddl/projects/3d-laplatgan/
visual_abstract: /assets/img/projects/3d_laplatgan/teaser-pic.jpg

#--- Optional description of the graphical abstract.
#--- You may use plain HTML for complex text constructions, like subscript.
visual_abstract_description: Full architecture of LSLP-GAN model. The network either accepts or generates an initial point cloud X<sub>0</sub> and processes it with a series of K learnable steps. Each step (1) upsamples its input using a non-learnable operator U, (2) encodes the upsampled version into the latent space by f<sub>k</sub>, (3) performs correction of the latent code via a conditional GAN G<sub>k</sub>, and (4) decodes the corrected latent code using g<sub>k</sub>.

#--- Optional thumbnail that will be displayed in the rich list of the projects
#--- and in the title page of the website if front_id is set,
#--- e.g http://adase.group/3ddl/publications/#2020
#--- If not set but visual_abstract is set then it will be used.
thumbnail: /assets/img/projects/3d_laplatgan/thumbnail.jpg
#--- A couple of remarks regarding visual_abstract and thumbnail.
#--- First, do not put them in assets/img, put them in src/img and recompile,
#--- see https://github.com/adasegroup/adasegroup.github.io/wiki/How-to-Add-a-Project-Page
#--- Second, compress them as much as possible without loss of readability.
#--- You don't want the other researchers that come to our website wait for too long while the page is loading.
#--- `convert source_thumbnail.ext -thumbnail '400x250>' -background white -gravity center -extent 400x250 thumbnail.jpg`
#--- and `convert source_teaser.ext -resize "2000x2000" teaser.jpg` usually suffice.

#--- Optional section with materials that will be displayed in the project page and in the list of the projects.
