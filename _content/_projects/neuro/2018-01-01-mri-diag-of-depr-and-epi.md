abstract: "â€”In the present work, we study the candidate biomarkers for the depression disorder and the depression + epilepsy comorbidity. Building on the advanced data analysis
pipeline, we identify candidate biomarkers, compare them across tasks and to the previous research. The classification performance achieved by our system compares favourably to the one reported in literature, where longer scanning sessions and stronger magnetic fields were employed."
