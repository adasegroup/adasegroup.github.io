# Motivation
Often, full-scale computational experiments are expensive. In addition, there are situations where “physical” models are unavailable.

# Objective
To achieve this, our objetive is to construct data-driven (surrogate) models capable of:
- predicting behavior
- performing model-based control and recommend future actions
- optimizing design and performance
- detecting anomalies and predict failures

# Challenges
There are several challenges involved in the construction of surrogate models such as:
1. The data sources have viariable degrees of fidelity (e.g. AT, computer models)
2. Complex shapes and structure present in the data at hand. Some examples are:
- The sample is generated on a manifold
- The data represents an anisotropic sample distribution or includes imbalanced distribution of labels
- The description of the data relates to a 3D object such as CAD models
- The data set is a multidimensional time-series
3. Local accuracy prediction is required

# Tasks
- surrogate model construction and surrogate optimization;
- anomaly detection and rare events prediction (aka imbalanced classification);
- adaptive design of experiments (aka active learning);
- on-line learning for streaming data.
